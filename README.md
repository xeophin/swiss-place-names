# swissnames

This project is generated with [yo angular generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular)
version 0.15.1.

## Build & development

Run `grunt` for building and `grunt serve` for preview.

## Testing

Running `grunt test` will run the unit tests with karma, but the tests have 
not been written because of the size of the project.

## Semantic UI

The project uses a modified version of Semantic UI. Since it needs to be 
implemented using Bower, the changes are not in the repository and only local
 on Kaspar's laptop so far.
